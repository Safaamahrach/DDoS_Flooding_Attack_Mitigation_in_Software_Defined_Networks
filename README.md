# DDoS_Flooding_Attack_Mitigation_in_Software_Defined_Networks
 In this repository, we propose a lightweight and practical mitigation mechanism to protect SDN architecture against DDoS flooding threats and ensure a secure and efficient SDN-based networking environment. Our proposal extends the Data Plane (DP) with a classification and mitigation module to analyze the new incoming packets, classify the benign requests from the SYN flood attacks, and perform the adaptive countermeasures.
